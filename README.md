# Navigator Based on Pedestrian Tracking and GPS for Visually Impaired People (iOS Application)

## Introduction

### Purpose:

**"Navigator Based on Pedestrian Tracking and GPS for Visually Impaired People (iOS Application)"** (“The Navigator”) aims to offer a reliable guiding assistance for visually impaired people.

Currently, visually impaired people always need guiding tools like tactile sticks or guide dogs when navigating outdoor. However, the number of guide dogs is limited and the tactile stick cannot provide accurate and informative feedback to the users. As technology advances, smart devices with AI technology can be combined and act as a new generation of guiding devices. 

### Method:

The Navigator will use user’s GPS location to plan a route from user’s location to the destination, then the Navigator start uses the camera on the mobile device and an object tracking AI model to guide the user to follow pedestrian who is heading to the same destination. Whenever the pedestrian being followed is found not sharing the same destination as the user does, the Navigator will choose another pedestrian. Furthermore, the main feedback medium for guiding the users’ direction is haptic. Sound is only used when sending complicated or dangerous messages to the user. 

### Result:

 The Navigator is able plan a route from user’s location to destination, follow a pedestrian ahead of user and provide appropriate feedbacks to the user. Significance The Navigator integrated with advanced software technologies and a single hardware, the smart mobile device, can potentially provide a low cost temporary replacement for visually impaired people while they are waiting for their own guide dog. Therefore the Navigator may help visually impaired people utilize social resources and services more efficiently during their waiting time, hence better the inclusion of visually impaired people to our society.
